The gay community centre assigns him to Robert (Geoff Edholm), a 32 year - old politically impassioned California gardener abandoned by his friends and lovers. Revolving around the confines of Robert’s Manhattan hospital room, Bressan skillfully unfolds this two - hander with devastating effect. Tragically both Arthur J. Bressan and Geoff Edholm went on to die from complications of AIDS.\\n\\n\\\"Bressan Jr’s film is full of fury, both explicit and subtle. It takes aim at the Reagan administration’s failure to act on the Aids crisis, and hits its target again and again. Compare this with the glossy Oscar-winning theatrics of Tom Hanks’s opera scene in Philadelphia (1993) and the pugnacious spirit of Buddies seems even more potent. Yes, it’s appalling that young men are dying, but the tragedy must be coupled with a fierce resolve to fight back – a battle cry ignored by so many Aids dramas of the era, which got lost in the excitement of A-list straight actors playing tragic gay victims.\\n\\nEdholm, who also died from Aids-related illness in 1989, has an arresting scene where he chokes with anger when he reads a homophobic article stating that Aids is God’s punishment on gay men. Yet the most powerful sequence pulsates with an understated rage; a final overhead shot of the White House cuts to a printer churning out an endless list of those who have died from Aids-related illness.\\n\\nBuddies’ authenticity is its greatest strength. This is a rare film from the era, made by and about gay men, and it movingly evokes the loneliness and isolation of so many with Aids. Robert never leaves his hospital room, where he lies alone, surrounded by messages warning medics to exert caution around Aids patients.\\\" BFI\\n\\nPlease note there are NO ads or trailers, we start on time!\\nPink Palace is a super low fi highly relaxed event that takes place in the basement bar, its a safe queer space so come along and catch some queer film and pop culture history, each week the film is introduced by curator Andrew Woodyatt, and feel free to stay and chat afterwards, participation is encouraged!\",\"starring\":\"Geoff Edholm, David Schachter, Damon Hairston, Joyce Korn, Billy Lux, David Rose\",\"directedBy\":\"Arthur J.

As mainstream success eludes our heroine, leading her to unite with a ragtag team of rejects, misfits, and a certain love interest named Mister J, \\\"Joker the Harlequin\\\" is born again as a confident (and psychotic) joker on a collision course with the city's fascist caped crusader. Vats of feminizing chemicals, sexy cartoon interludes, scarecrow psychiatrists, CGI Lorne Michaels, and psychedelic gender dysphoria all play supporting roles. Helmed by writer/director/editor/star Vera Drew and using her own life experiences as a basis for the film, THE PEOPLE'S JOKER is a deeply personal journey that's as much documentary as it is parody.\\n\\nPlease note there are NO ads or trailers, we start on time!\\n\\nPink Palace is a super low fi highly relaxed event that takes place in the basement bar, its a safe queer space so come along and catch some queer film and pop culture history, each week the film is introduced by curator Andrew Woodyatt, and feel free to stay and chat afterwards, participation is encouraged!\",\"starring\":\"Vera Drew, Lynn Downey, Kane Distler\",\"directedBy\":\"Vera Drew\",\"producedBy\":null,\"searchTerms\":\"\",\"duration\":92,\"genre\":null,\"allGenres\":null,\"rating\":\"TBC\",\"trailerYoutubeId\":\"9M00AB03S_4\",\"trailerVideo\":null,\"releaseDate\":\"2025-02-25\",\"dateOfFirstShowing\":\"2025-02-26\",\"tmdbPopularityScore\":null,\"tmdbId\":null,\"dcmEdiMovieId\":\"341226\",\"dcmEdiMovieName\":\"Blackpink The Movie (Concert) (2D) [12A]\",\"siteId\":\"84\",\"titleClassId\":\"52\",\"showings\":[{\"id\":\"263452\",\"time\":\"2025-02-26T20:00:00Z\",\"ticketsSold\":8,\"screenId\":\"122\",\"seatsRemaining\":17,\"displayMetaData\":\"{\\\"classes\\\":\\\"ludski-bar pink-palace\\\"}\"},{\"id\":\"265071\",\"time\":\"2025-03-03T19:30:00Z\",\"ticketsSold\":0,\"screenId\":\"122\",\"seatsRemaining\":25,\"displayMetaData\":\"{\\\"classes\\\":\\\"ludski-bar pink-palace\\\"}\"}]},{\"id\":\"20888\",\"name\":\"Dory Previn; On My Way to Where + director Q\\u0026A\",\"showingStatus\":\"On Sale\",\"urlSlug\":\"dory-previn-on-my-way-to-where-director-qa\",\"posterImage\":\"w25wscbmz2zguinkwyqlhq4ie08v\",\"bannerImage\":\"rfbqo9cv95dg41vz48m6u0sjvf8k\",\"synopsis\":\"A Doc 'n Roll Presentation\\n\\n“If you’ve never heard of Dory Previn, prepare to be ashamed of yourself.\\\" – Rex Reed\\n\\nWriting and singing the unvarnished truth about buried secret life experiences is more common today than when Dory Previn wrote brilliant, disturbing and \\ndarkly funny songs in the 1970s.

And now that Andrea Dworkin’s words are turning out to predict headlines, from Time’s Up! to the gender of terrorism, this film will illuminate what's going on and help us to know what to do.” Gloria Steinem\\n\\nAndrea Dworkin was a controversial feminist thinker, known to some as the personification of one side of the debates about pornography and female sexual freedom in the 1980s. As Parmar’s film reveals, this reductive characterisation is untrue and does a disservice to Dworkin herself and to feminism in general.\\n\\nThrough Dworkin’s life and work, the film challenges us to rethink the hierarchies of domination and submission that infuse our sexual, social and economic relationships. Dworkin is played at different periods of her life by different actors, including Andrea Riseborough and Ashley Judd. The film covers many aspects that influenced her passionate dedication to female freedom, including her sexual assault while at the New York Women's House of Detention, her friendships with Catherine MacKinnon, Allen Ginsberg and John Stoltenberg, and her difficult family and personal relationships. Most importantly, though, it concentrates on her writing and her public appearances, immaculately researched and presented through rare archive footage.\\n\\nContent Guidance: Film contains strong references and discussions on violence and sexual abuse.\\n\\nThe Rio feminist film programming group is Sarah Chorley, Selina Robertson and Helen de Witt. Inspired by the passionate feminist programming work that took place at the Rio in the 1980s by Rio Women’s Cinema and the Women’s Media Resource Project, we are reinstating feminist film screening and events that link the Rio’s feminist history with contemporary feminisms.
